# E1006I - Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Computer Scientists

This GitHub repository supports the Dept. of Computer Science, Columbia University course
_E1008 - Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientists_. The current content is for
the Spring 2018 semester.

## Overview

This course will teach you Python programming, but is not only a course on writing programs and
and learning the Python
language. There are many, many, many ways to learn to learn Python and programming.
Almost all of the learning methods are more enjoyable than attending lectures,
working on and submitting homework projects, and studying for/taking exams.
Python and writing code are tools for computing an outcome.

The modern world,
and especially engineering and science in the modern world, is only possible because we can
applying computing technology to
process input data and compute a desired outcome from the data.
This course will use the Python language and
Python programming to introduce you to computing,
and applying computing to produce outcomes. The course is an introduction and provides a
starting foundation for future courses and your career, which will rely heavily on computing technology.

_Computing Outcomes?_ "Gee, can you vague that up for me?"
([Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 1, episode 1 - "Welcome to the Hellmouth."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Hellmouth) My girlfriend
tells me that a quote from Buffy helps clarify anything).
We will use Python and basic principles of Computer Science to incrementally build simple solutions in
four areas:
1. An interactive, database driven web application.
1. Numerical simulation to predict a system's behavior given initial conditions.
1. Data analytics and insight.
1. Machine learning.

The list is not a complete list of the domains in which computing produces outcomes
for engineering and applied science, but it is
an interesting subset. These four domains are major branches of Computer
Science and software engineering. We will not be able to dive deeply into
any of the domains. We will use simple problems from the domains to understand
the role of computing in engineering/applied science, and for learning
Python and CS principles. Any of these solution domains require a
significant amount of enablement libraries, frameworks and supporting software.
Installing, configuring and learning the enabling tools can take more time, in the beginning,
than the actual project. The TAs and I will provide help and guidance for setup, and project
templates into which you can place your programs and modules.
