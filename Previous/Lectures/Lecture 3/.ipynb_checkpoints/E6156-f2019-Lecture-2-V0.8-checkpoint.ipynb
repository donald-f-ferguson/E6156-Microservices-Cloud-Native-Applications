    "### Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "From and [excellent overview site](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) by SW leader Martin Fowler.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Componentization via Services:\n",
    "    - A component is a unit of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable.\n",
    "    - Microservice architectures will use libraries, but their primary way of componentizing their own software is by breaking down into services.\n",
    "        - Libraries are components that are linked into a program and called using in-memory function calls\n",
    "        - While services are out-of-process components who communicate with a mechanism such as a web service request, or remote procedure call.    \n",
    "    - __Note:__ I do not completely agree.\n",
    "        - The microservice design focuses on the ability to have services run in different processes.\n",
    "        - Program and design to a \"out of process\" model but may deploy together, in-process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organized around Business Capabilities:\n",
    "    - When looking to split a large application into parts, often management focuses on the technology layer, leading to UI teams, server-side logic teams, and database teams. \n",
    "    - When teams are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project taking time and budgetary approval.\n",
    "    - The microservice approach to division is different, splitting up into services organized around business capability. Such services take a broad-stack implementation of software for that business area, including user-interface, persistant storage, and any external collaborations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Products not Projects:\n",
    "    - Most application development efforts that we see use a project model: where the aim is to deliver some piece of software which is then considered to be completed. \n",
    "    - Microservice proponents tend to avoid this model, preferring instead the notion that a team should own a product over its full lifetime.\n",
    "    - The product mentality, ties in with the linkage to business capabilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Smart endpoints and dumb pipes:\n",
    "    - When building communication structures between different processes, we've seen many products and approaches that stress putting significant smarts into the communication mechanism itself. (See [Enterprise Service Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus).\n",
    "    - Applications built from microservices aim to be as decoupled and as cohesive as possible - they own their own domain logic and act more as filters in the classical Unix sense - receiving a request, applying logic as appropriate and producing a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decentralized Governance:\n",
    "    - One of the consequences of centralized governance is the tendency to standardize on single technology platforms. Experience shows that this approach is constricting - not every problem is a nail and not every solution a hammer.\n",
    "    - Polyglot programming, polyglot persistence, just consume the right frameworks for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decentralized Data Management:\n",
    "    - Decentralization of data management presents in a number of different ways. At the most abstract level, it means that the conceptual model of the world will differ between systems. (Microservice own and choose their data model).\n",
    "    - Microservices prefer letting each service manage its own database, either different instances of the same database technology, or entirely different database systems.\n",
    "    - Eventual consistency versus transactional consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Infrastructure Automation:\n",
    "    - Use of [Continuous Delivery:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) \"Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.[1] It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.\" \n",
    "    - Tools automate test, promotion, ... on code commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design for failure:\n",
    "    - A consequence of using services as components, is that applications need to be designed so that they can tolerate the failure of services.\n",
    "    - Things fail on the Internet. Get over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evolutionary Design:\n",
    "    - The key property of a component is the notion of independent replacement and upgradeability - which implies we look for points where we can imagine rewriting a component without affecting its collaborators.\n",
    "    - Small, continuous, incremental evolution of components (aligning with [Agile Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)) instead of release cycles.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Second Perspective Event-Centric, Event-First, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional SOA and applications focus on components being aware of and calling other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event-centric model is:\n",
    "    - What can happen in the environment?\n",
    "    - Which microservices need to react to the event?\n",
    "    - What events happen because of the action?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Much looser coupling and incremental addition or change of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will start seeing some examples in this lecture as we build an event-driven microservice."

REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by __using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.__ Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.\" \\(Emphasis added\\).(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Function as a service (FaaS)\" is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. Building an application following this model is one way of achieving a \"serverless\" architecture, and is typically used when building microservices applications.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service)\n",

    "The name \"serverless computing\" is used because the server management and capacity planning decisions are completely hidden from the developer or operator. Serverless code can be used in conjunction with code deployed in traditional styles, such as microservices.

    "## Another Aside $-$ NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A NoSQL (originally referring to \"non SQL\" or \"non relational\") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the \"NoSQL\" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages, or sit alongside SQL database in a polyglot persistence architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler \"horizontal\" scaling to clusters of machines (which is a problem for relational databases), and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as \"more flexible\" than relational database tables\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic reasons two use a \"Not Only SQL Database:\"\n",
    "- The application does not require RDB functions, which means a reduced function DB can be cheaper, faster, more available, ...\n",

    "- There is good [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.API.html) on the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several good [tutorials.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dynamodb/index.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Countless samples and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a lot of APIs, but there is a relatively straightforward, common core. From the manual:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Control Plane: Control plane operations let you create and manage DynamoDB tables. They also let you work with indexes, streams, and other objects that are dependent on tables.\n",
    "    - CreateTable – Creates a new table. Optionally, you can create one or more secondary indexes, and enable DynamoDB Streams for the table.\n",
    "    - DescribeTable– Returns information about a table, such as its primary key schema, throughput settings, and index information.\n",
    "    - ListTables – Returns the names of all of your tables in a list.\n",
    "    - UpdateTable – Modifies the settings of a table or its indexes, creates or removes new indexes on a table, or modifies DynamoDB Streams settings for a table.\n",
    "    - DeleteTable – Removes a table and all of its dependent objects from DynamoDB.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Data Plane: Data plane operations let you perform create, read, update, and delete (also called CRUD) actions on data in a table. Some of the data plane operations also let you read data from a secondary index.\n",
    "    - Creating Data\n",
    "        - PutItem – Writes a single item to a table. You must specify the primary key attributes, but you don't have to specify other attributes.\n",
    "        - BatchWriteItem – Writes up to 25 items to a table. This is more efficient than calling PutItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to write the items. You can also use BatchWriteItem for deleting multiple items from one or more tables.\n",
    "    - Reading Data\n",
    "        - GetItem – Retrieves a single item from a table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want. You can retrieve the entire item, or just a subset of its attributes.\n",
    "        - BatchGetItem – Retrieves up to 100 items from one or more tables. This is more efficient than calling GetItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to read the items.\n",
    "        - Query – Retrieves all items that have a specific partition key. You must specify the partition key value. You can retrieve entire items, or just a subset of their attributes. Optionally, you can apply a condition to the sort key values so that you only retrieve a subset of the data that has the same partition key. You can use this operation on a table, provided that the table has both a partition key and a sort key. You can also use this operation on an index, provided that the index has both a partition key and a sort key.\n",
    "        - Scan – Retrieves all items in the specified table or index. You can retrieve entire items, or just a subset of their attributes. Optionally, you can apply a filtering condition to return only the values that you are interested in and discard the rest.\n",
    "    - Updating Data\n",
    "        - UpdateItem – Modifies one or more attributes in an item. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to modify. You can add new attributes and modify or remove existing attributes. You can also perform conditional updates, so that the update is only successful when a user-defined condition is met. Optionally, you can implement an atomic counter, which increments or decrements a numeric attribute without interfering with other write requests.\n",
    "        - Deleting Data: DeleteItem – Deletes a single item from a table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to delete.\n",
    "        - BatchWriteItem – Deletes up to 25 items from one or more tables. This is more efficient than calling DeleteItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to delete the items. You can also use BatchWriteItem for adding multiple items to one or more tables.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Streams: DynamoDB Streams operations let you enable or disable a stream on a table, and allow access to the data modification records contained in a stream.\n",
    "    - ListStreams – Returns a list of all your streams, or just the stream for a specific table.\n",
    "    - DescribeStream – Returns information about a stream, such as its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and where your application can begin reading the first few stream records.\n",
    "    - GetShardIterator – Returns a shard iterator, which is a data structure that your application uses to retrieve the records from the stream.\n",
    "    - GetRecords – Retrieves one or more stream records, using a given shard iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transactions: Transactions provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) enabling you to maintain data correctness in your applications more easily.\n",
    "    - TransactWriteItems – A batch operation that allows Put, Update, and Delete operations to multiple items both within and across tables with a guaranteed all-or-nothing result.\n",
    "    - TransactGetItems – A batch operation that allows Get operations to retrieves multiple items from one or more tables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Note:__ This is only \"sort of ACID.\" True ACID handles multiple tables and interleaving of reads and writes.\n",
    "    - This is more like \"atomic multiple read\" or \"atomic multiple write.\" Which is useful, and a very common scenario in databases.\n",
    "    - Also, because of the more flexible data model, the application requires fewer tables. Multiple relational tables would often map to a single DynamoDB table."
