    "\n",
    "- Definition: \"A 'microservice' is a software development technique—a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and more resilient to architecture erosion. It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently. It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring. Microservices-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)\n",

Services include user management, push notifications, integration with social networking services and more. This is a relatively recent model in cloud computing,[74] with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later but trends indicate that these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise consumers.<br><br>\n",

Despite the name, it does not actually involve running code without servers. Serverless computing is so named because the business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase, rent or provision servers or virtual machines for the back-end code to run on.<br><br>\n",

Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue)\n",

Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)\n",

    "\n",
    "\"In computer software, a data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database. This isolation supports the single responsibility principle. It separates what data access the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the public interface of the DAO), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS, database schema, etc. (the implementation of the DAO).\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object)\n",
